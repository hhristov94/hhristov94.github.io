Orthogonality is a generalization of well known notion of perpendicularity in geometry. The word comes from the Greek ὀρθός (orthos), meaning "upright", and γωνία (gonia),meaning "angle". So two vectors in Euclidian space are orthogonal when the angle between them is 90 degrees. If you recall the definition of the dot product

$$
a \cdot b = \|a\|\|b\|cos\theta
$$

you will see that when the angle between the two vectors is $$90^{\circ}$$ the $$cos(\theta)$$ evaluates to $$0$$ and the whole dot product becomes $$0$$. Which leads to the following simple definition of an orthogonal set:
An orthogonal set is a set of vectors, any pair of which have dot product 0.

Again, the simplest example of an orthogonal set is the standard basis of $$\mathbb{R^3}$$

$$
{(\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0 \end{bmatrix}),
(\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\0 \end{bmatrix}),
(\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1 \end{bmatrix}),}
$$

What is very easily noticable is that all of the vectors are also linearly independent. This set is also called __orthonormal__ since every vector in the set has norm of $$1$$ which makes it an ideal basis.

Often more than not, orthogonal or orthonormal basis are much easier to work with. Thus, given a basis for a vector space, it is useful to transform it into an orthogonal one. This can be achieved using the Gram-Schmidt algorithm:





In the case of function spaces, families of orthogonal functions are used to form a basis.

By extension, orthogonality is also used to refer to the separation of specific features of a system. The term also has specialized meanings in other fields including art and chemistry.

By using integral calculus, it is common to use the following to define the inner product of two functions f and g with respect to a nonnegative weight function w over an interval [a, b]:
